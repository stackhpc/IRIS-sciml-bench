# IRIS-sciml-bench

This repository contains an IPython notebook for running the [STFC SciML Benchmarks](https://github.com/stfc-sciml/sciml-bench) codes.

It is designed to run in a Jupyterlab environment, deployed by the [Azimuth](https://github.com/stackhpc/azimuth/) portal using [Helm charts](https://github.com/stackhpc/demo-charts/) developed specifically for the IRIS project.

> :warning: **The benchmarks run by this notebook are RAM intensive - ensure that your Jupyter notebook server has been allocated at least a 10Gi memory limit!**
